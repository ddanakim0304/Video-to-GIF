# Video to GIF Converter

Welcome to the **Video to GIF Converter**! This PyQt-based app was created to solve a real problem: efficiently converting videos to GIFs with precise control over size and quality.


## Why This Project?

While building my portfolio, I needed GIFs for showcasing projects. Online tools were slow and tedious, requiring multiple uploads and tweaks. I wanted a **local solution** that was faster, offered control, and eliminated file size issues.
